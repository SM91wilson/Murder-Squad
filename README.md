# The Murder Squad

In today’s world, we are trying to find new ways to stay connected and re-create some of our favorite social interactions so we don’t lose touch - and our minds! With Murder Squad, you can get together with your friends (or solo!) to partake in America’s sixth favorite pastime: THE MURDER MYSTERY DINNER.

The end goal for Murder Squad would be an online platform for you and your friends to get together to recreate a murder mystery dinner - where you each get a character to play and follow a story, in rounds, to solve a murder. The working version of Murder Squad is the one-player version of the game which allows you to pick a character, receive and share their clues, and play with other simulated players to get to the bottom of the murder yourself.

Github Repository: https://github.com/SM91wilson/project2

## Process
Technologies:
-Bootstrap
-Heroku
-MySQL

## Challenges: 
Heroku Deployment, Game Logic (coming up with a way to make a multiplayer concept for single player use, Table Organization

## Successes: 
We worked very well together and were able to coordinate time to work both as a team and individually outside of class, merging of frontend and backend, use of github 
 
## Further Development:
-Multiplayer functionality: The initial concept of the game is to be a multiplayer game that recreates the experience of a murder mystery dinner. In order to do this, we would want to implement the following features:
-Chat Room/Video Chat 
-Direct Messaging
-Character bio creation
-Various playable storylines
-“What was the motive” field option as part of accusation – the real murder mystery paradigm
-We had initially aimed to include a voice-to-text API into the project as it was very text heavy. This is not included in our initial iteration of the app. It would be included with further development.
